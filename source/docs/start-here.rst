      Useful Resources
      ^^^
      A list of useful resources and accompanying descriptions, with especially pertinent ones marked.

      Being a Team
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Covers how to start, organize, and run an effective team.

      Design Strategy
      ^^^
      A list of general tips for your team's design process.

   .. grid-item-card::

      Design Tradeoffs
      ^^^
      Goes over some common robot design decisions and typically superior alternatives to them.

      :link-type: doc

      Drivetrains
      ^^^
      Because it doesn't matter how good the rest of your mechanisms are if the robot cannot get to where it needs to be (except maybe if you're 8813 in Relic Recovery).

      :link-type: doc

      Active Intake
      ^^^
      Because you want to be able to pick stuff up. Touch it, own it.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/common-mechanisms/linear-motion-guide/index
      :link-type: doc

      Linear Motion Guide
      ^^^
      Moving things further than the constraints of the robot is an extremely common task, and linear motion is often one of the best ways to do this.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/common-mechanisms/power-transmission/index
      :link-type: doc

      Power Transmission
      ^^^
      Different ways to get rotation from point A to point B.

      Options for Programming
      ^^^
      Because without programming, the robot is just an expensive brick.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/power-and-electronics/control-system
      :link-type: doc

      Control Systems
      ^^^
      Because without a control system, the robot is just a (significantly less) expensive brick.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/power-and-electronics/wiring
      :link-type: doc

      Wiring Guide
      ^^^
      Because disconnects are no fun.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/software/tutorials/mecanum-drive
      :link-type: doc

      Programming Tutorial - Mecanum Drivetrain
      ^^^
      Because mecanum wheels without the right code are some very expensive questionable quality traction wheels.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :link: /docs/software/tutorials/vision
      :link-type: doc

      Computer Vision
      ^^^
      Explains the different common computer vision systems and how to use them (hopefully this doesn't end with a robot uprising).

   Laser Cutter
      A laser cutter is a tool that uses a high-power laser to cut through sheet metal or similar material. The laser is guided by CNC to cut preprogrammed patterns into the sheet.

   Waterjet Cutter
      A waterjet cutter is a tool which cuts sheet metal and other materials via extremely high pressure water focused into a small stream. Waterjet cutters are commonly used in industrial fabrication and can follow preprogrammed instructions to cut patterns, similar to a CNC system.

   Standoff
      A standoff is a fastener with two threaded ends and usually has a hex profile to be used with a wrench. These ends are usually female threaded, meaning that they can have a screw threaded into them.

      This is usually a more compact alternative to a long screw and spacers, and can be used to space things out as well as fasten them. Custom standoffs can be made out of hex stock, such as :term:`AndyMark Churro <Churro>`.

      Standoffs are usually used in drivetrain purposes, such as in parallel plate drivetrains, where the plates must be separated and supported by standoffs at equal distances.

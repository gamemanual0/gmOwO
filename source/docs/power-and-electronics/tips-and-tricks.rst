Tips and Tricks
===============

In addition to what is written in the official resources, there are a couple of additional tips.

The traditional :term:`XT30` connector that is used to REV is prone to breaking. It is highly recommended that teams replace :term:`XT30` connectors with :term:`Anderson PowerPole`, or put adapters on their current wires. An example of an adapter is `this <https://www.servocity.com/anderson-powerpole-to-female-xt30-adaptor>`_. In lieu of this, teams can also 3D print strain relief connectors on the Expansion Hub to prevent :term:`XT30` disconnects. The file can be found on Thingiverse or through this `link <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2887045>`_.

   An example :term:`Anderson PowerPole` (A) to :term:`XT30` (B) adapter. They can be found at `ServoCity <https://www.servocity.com/anderson-powerpole-to-female-xt30-adaptor/>`_ or `REV Robotics <https://www.revrobotics.com/REV-31-1385/>`_.

The Tamiya connectors found on many of the FTC\ |reg| legal batteries are very weak and prone to becoming unreliable after many repeated plug/unplug cycles. It is recommended that teams crimp new :term:`Anderson PowerPole` connectors onto the battery.

It is highly recommended for teams to use the `REV grounding strap <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/>`_ and the `REV USB strain relief <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1214/>`_ to help prevent disconnections.

To protect wires, teams often use `wire loom <https://www.amazon.com/Black-Split-Tubing-Cover-Marine/dp/B00J7RD6ZI/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=wire+loom&qid=1562452458&s=gateway&sr=8-13>`_, and to help wires extend far, teams often use cable carrier (also known as cable chain).
